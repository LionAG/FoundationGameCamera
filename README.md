## Notes

This project is still under development. As such some things may work partially and/or incorrectly.

The display hook is not fully functional - to use it follow the steps:

1. Set the desired values using the overlay sliders.
2. Go to display settings and move the brightness slider in any way.

Note: Using a custom resolution scale still requires using windowed mode.
